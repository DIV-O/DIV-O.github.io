<p>Divo ontology was developed to describe the various levels of analysis that can be found within the Divina Commedia. We decided to analyze the Canto V of Inferno. Four levels of analysis were selected: the apparatus of comments, characters, places and literary reference linked to the text.
  The ontology contains three main classes: Agent, LiteraryElement and Places.
  The Agent class includes the classes of Editor, FictionalCharacter and RealPerson: these classes allow to describe the world of real and fictional characters that refers to the Divina Commedia. 
  The LiteraryElement class contains some of the elements of literature and in particular of the Divina Commedia: Cantica, Canto, Edition, Commentary, Line, LiteraryReference, LiteraryWork and Style. 
  Finally, the Place class allows you to describe all the places to which Dante refers in the Divina Commedia. They are divided into FictionalPlace and RealPlace.</p>
